            I was at a sushi restaurant in Kanazawa a few years ago, chatting with a young British traveler, when she engaged me as if I was a Fukuoka travel guide. “I wasn’t even sure if it was worth visiting,” the young woman explained, noting that she’d only decided to stop a night in the city because the cheapest flight to Seoul she could find left from there.
            “But I’m open to suggestions.”</p>
