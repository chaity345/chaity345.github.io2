        <p>When my dad was building the itinerary for our trip to Japan, Kyushu was high on his list. I’d been to Kyushu 20 years ago and we made it as far as Fukuoka. We were meant to explore the south and west of the island, but a typhoon came in and cut that trip short. I know this has stayed in my dad’s mind as a “miss” for me, so it was a top priority destination for this trip.</p>
